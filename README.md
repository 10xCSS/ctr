##  Preamble Context
I wrote `ctr` a lifetime ago, and while the core principles of `ctr` remain intact, some of the specific details might not wholly align with my current perspective. Nevertheless, aside from a few dated elements, `ctr` has stood the test of time and has proven to be rock-solid through years of my daily use. Which is why I've decided to keep the original text as it is — as both a genuine glimpse into the foundation of 10xCSS and a starting point for future endeavors.

**Usage Notes**: If you want to give `ctr` a test spin, I'd recommend doing so through the live docs at [docs.ctr-lang.com](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/), where you can experiment without needing to install anything. Otherwise, for an optimal experience, use Node `v10.24.1`; however, newer Node versions should also be compatible. There is a rare-ish edge case involving deeply nested states and their interactions with elements, in which the state pseudo-class (`:hover, :focus`) may be incorrectly applied to the component rather than the element. To be honest, I can't recall the exact specifics, but it's related to changes in the array sorting behavior in Node `v10.24.1+` and Immutable.js `v3.8.1`.


## Description

There are many words/examples you can read in the [documentation](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/) that detail what, why, and how, but I’ll give a brief overview. `ctr` is a CSS framework built with JavaScript to provide object oriented functionality to allow for a rich hierarchy of inherited CSS components to better facilitate a CSS architecture similar to [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki). Albeit `ctr` and OOCSS differ vastly in application and you construct your CSS in `ctr` using true objects which allows for `ctr` to be constructed in [YAML](http://yaml.org/), JavaScript, and [Less](http://lesscss.org/). Although `ctr` shares the same goal of OOCSS - encouraging code reuse as well as maintainable CSS styles.

The object oriented architecture of `ctr` also allows for a rich hierarchy of inherited CSS components so that it’s not required to list each class in your HTML every single time. A functionality that is encompassed through the [class](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/class/general/) feature of `ctr`. An idea presented by [Philip Walton](philipwalton.com/about/) and his article [The Future of OOCSS: A Proposal](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-future-of-oocss-a-proposal/). However, to accomplish this, there has to be a supporting framework, and that is what `ctr` and all its various features provide.

My favorite feature of `ctr` is its ability to abstract away the tedium and pain-points from creating complex CSS logic for pseudo-classes such as `hover`, `focus`, and `active`. All you need to do is list the CSS properties and values in the [state](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/state/general/) object, and `ctr` automatically configures the proper pseudo-class and the corresponding negation CSS pseudo-class (`:not()`). It also configures the `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-delay`, and `transition-timing-function` for all CSS properties. Furthermore, `ctr` provides similar abstractions for [animation](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/animation/general/), [elements](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/element/general/) such as `before` and `after`, as well as [media queries](https://docs.ctr-lang.com/media/general/), and much much more.

Finally, `ctr` comes pre-packed with some of the best CSS libraries such as:
+ Animate.css for animation presets

## Status

As I've outlined over at [ctr-lang.com](https://ctr-lang.com) and in the [documentation](https://docs.ctr-lang.com), the code base is extended way past its means. <s>That being said, the hope is that I'll be able to secure funding to embark on a rewrite from the ground up.</s> At the same time, things are pretty solid, so it goes without saying I believe and hope it will be nothing but smooth sailing for you as well.


## Bugs & Contributions

I'm on the fence as to how I want to handle bug and contributions, but I'll lay down my current thoughts. I initially had hoped to raise funding for a rewrite but that obviously was wishful thinking, although, not all is lost because the code base is workable up to a point. I'll gladly spend the time fixing bugs if they warrant the time. However, if it's a complex edge case I doubt I will spend the time. So if you think it warrants my time and yours by all accounts, please pull an issue.


## Structure

For the time being, all `ctr` assets reside under this repository, that is the, Stylus plugin, Less plugin, YAML API, and the JavaScript API. Hopefully, the rewrite will materialize, and if that's the case, I'll separate assets out to create a much cleaner structure.


+ `/lib` -> Allz the magic
    * `ctr-stylus.js` -> Stylus Plugin Logic
    * `ctr-less.js` -> Less Plugin Logic
    * `ctr-js.js` -> Js API class constructor
    * `/ctr-js-nodes` -> All Js methods for the `ctr-js.js` class
    * `/ctr-js-nodes` -> The actual logic behind `ctr`
+ `/dist`
    * `ctr.styl` -> The most important file, which is both embarrassing and impressive in its own right. This Stylus file contains two Stylus Functions that act as a janky templating solution to provide the proper syntactical structure. Along the lines of mustache but for CSS. Removing this file; thus the Stylus dependency is one of the main reasons for the rewrite.
+ `__tests__` -> Allz the test, and it has it's own `README.md`
